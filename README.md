## Content:
### 1NTPPP
A first try at the problem of the lead for games with a very regular bidding 1NT,P,P,P
1. 1nt.ipynb: Approach using Scikit learn machine learning machinery (Zig) 

2. CNN_version1_for_1NTPPP.ipynb: Approach using CNN with TensorFlow (P-E)

3. Deep Learning: Approach using FFNN with TF (Zyied)

### auxiliary_functions
Folder with parsing auxiliary functions that could be useful for other people.
1. encode_and_parsing:
  a. encode: Encode and Decode the String representing the bidding to an array of numbers
  b. parsing: functions for reading the hands of players and determining the lead. Hands are encoded in 4 52-vectors of booleans representing the presence or not of the card, one for each player

2. parseHeading: Tools to decode the heading of .lin files according to HowToReadHeading

3. HowToReadHeading: Human decodification of .lin headings

### Download_BBO
1. raw_lin_data: .lin from 42300 to 53439, downloaded from BBO. The rest (00000-42299) are in "https://github.com/eitazhou/bridge_played_hands/tree/master/raw_lin_data"

2. downBBOpX.py: X stands for the python version. Downloands results of a search from: "http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph_archives/vugraph_archives.php"

3. download_BBO_new_lins: script used to download raw_lin_data. Should run again if you want most recent games (last ran 29/09/17)

### parsing
1. Parsing_first_try: Quick parsing to generate the 1NTPPP data used on first analysis

2. extract_part0.py: Final extraction, parses all files and generates a pickle, All.bin, which is in the Pickle_Data

### Pickle_Data
Folder with the data we were able to extract and interface to interact with this data
1. All.rar: All the data we obtained,(~2 million games). It is nothing more than a list of BridgeDeal's objects generated by "extract_part0.py". Be aware! The file has 1 Gb when uncompressed. To use it take a look at "extract_data.py".

2. extract_data.py: This script allows you to manipulate (read/search/save) our database of played hands. Probably the file you are looking for.

### SQL_Data
1. tournament-script.sql: Skeleton of the SQL database

## Aknowledgements
Thank you VÃ©ronique Ventos and Tristan for the guidance in this daring project
And specially to every member of the team: 
Ayman, Eduardo, Ian, Pierre-Emmanuel, Yann, Zigfrid and Zyied!
