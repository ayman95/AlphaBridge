# AlphaBridge
IA qui implemente l'entame au bridge


--------------------------------------

FILES:

--->All.rar
  This is our first database of played hands. It is nothing more than a list of BridgeDeal's objects generated by "extract_part0.py". Be aware! The file has 1 Gb when uncompressed. To use it take a look at "extract_data.py".

--->TODO
  self-explanatory

--->extract_data.py
  This script allows you to manipulate (read/search/save) our database of played hands. Probably the file you are looking for.

--->extract_part0.py
  The program will generate a list of played hands from the .lin files downloaded from BBO.
  Ian has already run the script (15/11) and the results are in the file "All.rar".
  Unless something went wrong, there is no need to run it again.
