The approach to retrieve the games was discontinued since "extract_part0.py" does a much better job.

---------------------
First try at solving 1NTPPP

To extract games that fit the criteria (1NTPPP), we proceed as follows:

1) We search for the pattern 1NTPPP in the lin files in "raw_lin_files"

2) We format the output from the first part into a more readable string

3) We parse the output from the previous step to a vector and try ML for the first time.

Each step has its folder.
